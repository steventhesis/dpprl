# dpprl

A DPP implementation on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Movies Recommendation System from the paper:

Zhao, X., Zhang, L., Xia, L., Ding, Z., Yin, D., & Tang, J. (2019). Deep reinforcement learning for list-wise recommendations.

The implementation is heavily built on the following code repo: 

egipcy. (2020). List-wise recommendation framework based on deep reinforcement learning. https://github.com/egipcy/LIRD. GitHub.

This decision was made to run the experiment in the available time, and to built on top of a stable fundament.

# Requirements

* Python 3
* Tensorflow 1.15
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Dppy

# Usage

Install required packages<br>
run python deep-dpprl-dpp.py

# Configurations

The dataset is split into train, validation, and test sets to make the experiment as valid as possible.<br>
By tuning the nb_episodes parameter the model is tested on diversifying performance through the episodes.
